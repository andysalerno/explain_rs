.TH "EXAMPLE"
This is a blank text line.
This is another text line.
This is a text line
that is split across two lines.

.SH "MAN-STYLE HEADER"
This is a line directly underneath the header above.

This is a text line that occurs after an empty line.

You can see that an indentation is automatically added after a '.sh' header.
.SH "ANOTHER HEADER"
.br
.sp
More text.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
some nofill text
on a different line
etc
.fi
.sp
.SH "NEXT HEADER"
.nf
some more nf text
one more line
.fi
.SH "ANOTHER HEADER"
this text isnt nofill at all
.SH "ONE LAST ONE"
This is some text.
.PP
The PP macro always adds a full blank line (two newlines)
like you are seeing here.

However, when it appears after a header:
.SH "SOME HEADER"
.PP
It only produces a single newline, with no empty verticle space.
