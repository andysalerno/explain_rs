.TH "EXAMPLE"
This is a blank text line.
This is another text line.
This is a text line that is 
split across two lines.

.SH "MAN-STYLE HEADER"
This is a line directly underneath the header above.

This is a text line that occurs after an empty line.

You can see that an indentation is automatically added after a '.sh' header.
.SH "ANOTHER HEADER"
.br
.sp
More text.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
some nofill text
on a different line
etc
.fi
.sp
.SH "NEXT HEADER"
.nf
some more nf text
one more line
.fi
.SH "ANOTHER HEADER"
this text isnt nofill at all
.SH "ONE LAST ONE"
This is some text.
.PP
The PP macro always adds a full blank line (two newlines)
like you are seeing here.

However, when it appears after a header:
.SH "SOME HEADER"
.PP
It only produces a single newline, with no empty verticle space.

.SH "Paragraph Indentation"
When we open a paragraph with the pp tag:
.PP
This is what happens.

When we indent using .rs 4:
.RS 4
This is what happens.

When we pop with .re:
.RE
This is what happens.

.RB This alternates between regular and bold.
.RB This is the same, but  with      lots    of     spaces.
.B This is just plain old bold.

.SH "THIS TEXT IS IN QUOTES"
This is a sample body.

.SH THIS TEXT IS NOT IN QUOTES
Another sample body.

'. Here's some space to test stuff below:
.IP "--proto <protocols>"
Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use in the transfer. Protocols are
evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and are each a protocol name or
'all', optionally prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:
.RS
.TP 3
.B +
Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permitted (this is
the default if no modifier is used).
.TP
.B -
Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of protocols already permitted.
.TP
.B =
Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already permitted), though
subject to later modification by subsequent entries in the comma separated
list.
.RE
.IP
For example:
.RS
.TP 15
.B \fI--proto\fP -ftps
uses the default protocols, but disables ftps
.TP
.B  \fI--proto\fP -all,https,+http
only enables http and https
.TP
.B \fI--proto\fP =http,https
also only enables http and https
.RE
