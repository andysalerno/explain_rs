update:
turns out '.Bl' means "bullet list"
and '.It' means a bullet.

.Bl -bullet -offset -indent -compact
.It
Bullet one goes here.
.It
Bullet two goes here.
.El

global escape sequence is '\&'

[-s bytes] is produced by '.Op Fl s Ar bytes' (bytes is underlined or italic here)
[Fl s Ar bytes] is produced by '.Op \&Fl s \&Ar bytes'

idea: also show content from the 'examples' section, if they give an argument. 'explain --example cat'
also show all parts of the 'options' section with a different argument. like 'explain --args cat'

btw, 'Fl' means 'flag' and 'Ar' means 'argument'

a macro is called by putting a dot '.' at the beginning of a line, followed by the two/three character macro name
